# QIIME_analysis

This repository contains all the scripts used in the QIIME analysis of the soil samples.
Most say what they do or which script they use in the title (for example, OTUs_24_default means closed reference OTU picking using 24 cores and the default database, and Open_OTUs_24_Silva means open OTU picking using 24 cores and the Silva database)
The scripts with a Q in front of their name used files that were quality filtered.

N.B: for me, should I want the .tre in Silva ref_database/Silva/SILVA_128_QIIME_release/trees/97/97_otus.tre
